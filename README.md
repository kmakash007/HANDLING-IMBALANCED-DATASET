# HANDLING-IMBALANCED-DATASET
An imbalanced dataset refers to a situation where the classes within the data have unequal representation. This means some classes, called the majority class, have many more data points than others, called the minority class.  This imbalance can cause problems for machine learning models, particularly those used for classification tasks.
